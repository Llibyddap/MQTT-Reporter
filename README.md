# MQTT Reporter

A program to report status of programs to an MQTT broker. Used to send data for mining rigs

It currently only transmits on, but I plan to make it send Mining Data and other system info

Contains an MSI installer and build Files
Installer located in DIST

change data.txt to your settings (empty for privacy reasons)
Also, the password entered into the txt file should be encrypted with a basic letter swap. See key in main.py
